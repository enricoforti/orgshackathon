<h1>AOM 2023 People and Organizations Hackathon PDW</h1>

**Saturday, Aug 5 2023 8:00AM - 12:00PM ET** at **Boston Park Plaza** in **White Hill Room**<br>

_Pre-registration is recommended for facilitating interactions during Part 2, but all AOM attendees are welcome to attend the entire PDW without pre-registration._

This hackathon aims to foster the development of macro-level research on topics associated with organization design, careers, and work performance. Participants will come together for a focused effort to collaboratively nurture a set of specific research “seeds”: a research question looking for a viable empirical strategy; a bleeding edge method looking for possible applications in management research; a dataset that may be of interest for management scholars. Contributors that are experts in their respective fields kickstart the event by providing the seeds. All participants will have the opportunity to brainstorm solutions to common empirical problems and develop new research designs to tackle challenging research questions. The event involves a high level of collaboration and creativity, as participants work quickly and intensively to generate new insights or solutions. Our goal is to offer an interactive and developmental session, fostering research collaborations between scholars at different stages of their careers and from different disciplinary and demographic backgrounds.

| Each contributor offers a max 8' presentation introducing a specific research “seed” — i.e., a research question looking for a viable empirical strategy; a bleeding edge method looking for possible applications in management research; a dataset that may be of interest for management scholars.<br /><br />Please click on the link next to each contributor's topic to access the seed material.<br /><br />`Bukky Akinsanmi` — Human Capital Capabilities: what has architecture got to do with it?

| **Part 2 — Hackathon: Growing the Research Seeds (Parallel Breakout Roundtable Sessions)**                                                                                     | **110 mins**     |
| Groups of attendees are invited to collaboratively develop research designs. The discussion at each roundtable is semi-structured, centred around the research “seeds” introduced in the plenary and attendees’ research expertise and interests. Scholars at different stages of their careers and from different disciplinary and demographic backgrounds will benefit from this format, since they will have the opportunity to interact in the more intimate and friendly environment of a roundtable. All tables will be provided with a structured template to aid the idea development process and facilitators will annotate the key ideas discussed in each table to facilitate further discussion and research collaborations.<br /><br />Includes one break (10 mins).<br /><br /> <ul> **Seed Table 1.** _Human Capital Capabilities: what has architecture got to do with it?_ <br />Seed Contributor: `Bukky Akinsanmi`<br />Facilitator: `Victoria Sevcenko` <br /><br /> **Seed Table 2.** _Esports as a natural laboratory for organizational research_ <br />Seed Contributor: `Julien Clement`<br />Facilitator: `Enrico Forti` <br /><br /> **Seed Table 3.** _Governance in decentralized autonomous orgs (DAOs)_ <br />Seed Contributor: `Ying-Ying Hsieh`<br />Facilitators: `Kim Claes`, `Piyush Gulati` <br /><br /> **Seed Table 4.** _Computational approaches to culture and creativity_ <br />Seed Contributor: `Monika Kackovic`<br />Facilitator: `Daphne Baldassari` <br /><br />**Seed Table 5.** _Organizational design research using computational models_ <br />Seed Contributor: `Harsh Ketkar`<br />Facilitators: `Maciej Workiewicz`, `Oliver Baumann` <br /><br /> **Seed Table 6.** _Architectural drivers of status signals_ <br />Seed Contributor: `James Riley`<br />Facilitator: `Ulya Tsolmon` <br /><br /></ul> | |
