<h1>AOM 2023 People and Organizations Hackathon PDW</h1>

**Saturday, Aug 5 2023 8:00AM - 12:00PM ET** at **Boston Park Plaza** in **White Hill Room**<br>

_Pre-registration is recommended for facilitating interactions during Part 2, but all AOM attendees are welcome to attend the entire PDW without pre-registration._

This hackathon aims to foster the development of macro-level research on topics associated with organization design, careers, and work performance. Participants will come together for a focused effort to collaboratively nurture a set of specific research “seeds”: a research question looking for a viable empirical strategy; a bleeding edge method looking for possible applications in management research; a dataset that may be of interest for management scholars. Contributors that are experts in their respective fields kickstart the event by providing the seeds. All participants will have the opportunity to brainstorm solutions to common empirical problems and develop new research designs to tackle challenging research questions. The event involves a high level of collaboration and creativity, as participants work quickly and intensively to generate new insights or solutions. Our goal is to offer an interactive and developmental session, fostering research collaborations between scholars at different stages of their careers and from different disciplinary and demographic backgrounds.

| **PDW Introduction and Overview on the Hackathon Format**<br /> `Enrico Forti`, `Ulya Tsolmon`, `Piyush Gulati`                                                                                         | **10 mins**      |
| **Part 1 — Hackathon: “Seeding” Macro and Micro Perspectives (Plenary)**                                                                           | **110 mins**     |
| Each contributor offers a max 7' presentation introducing a specific research “seed” — i.e., a research question looking for a viable empirical strategy; a bleeding edge method looking for possible applications in management research; a dataset that may be of interest for management scholars.<br /><br />`Bukky Akinsanmi` — Human Capital Capabilities: what has architecture got to do with it? [link](/research-seeds/Akinsanmi Oyedeji, Bukky)<br />`Julien Clement` — Esports as a natural laboratory for organizational research<br />`Ying-Ying Hsieh` — Governance in decentralized autonomous orgs (DAOs)<br />`Monika Kackovic` — Computational approaches to culture and creativity<br />`Harsh Ketkar` — Organizational design research using computational models<br />`James Riley` — Architectural drivers of status signals<br />`Chia-Jung Tsay` — Psychological biases and social evaluation<br /><br />Includes one break (10 mins). | |
| **Part 2 — Hackathon: Parallel Breakout Roundtable Sessions**                                                                                     | **110 mins**     |
| Groups of attendees are invited to collaboratively develop research designs. The discussion at each roundtable is semi-structured, centred around the research “seeds” introduced in the plenary and attendees’ research expertise and interests. Scholars at different stages of their careers and from different disciplinary and demographic backgrounds will benefit from this format, since they will have the opportunity to interact in the more intimate and friendly environment of a roundtable. All tables will be provided with a structured template to aid the idea development process and facilitators will annotate the key ideas discussed in each table to facilitate further discussion and research collaborations.<br /><br />Includes one break (10 mins).<br /><br />**Table Assignment: TBD based on pre-registration**<br />`Enrico Forti`, `Ulya Tsolmon`, `Daphne Baldassari`, `Victoria Sevcenko`, `Piyush Gulati`, `Kim Claes`, `Oliver Baumann`, `Maciej Workiewicz` facilitate interactions. | |
